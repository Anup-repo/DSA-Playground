# DSA - Data Structures & Algorithms

Welcome to the DSA repository! This is a collection of solutions to various problems related to **Data Structures** and **Algorithms**, including **Tree**, **Dynamic Programming (DP)**, **Arrays**, and **Strings**. These solutions are curated from learning platforms like **Learnyard** and **GeeksforGeeks (GFG)**.

The purpose of this repository is to help learners improve their problem-solving abilities and enhance their understanding of essential algorithms and data structures. Each problem comes with a well-structured solution, detailed explanations, and time complexity analysis wherever applicable.

## Problem Categories

- **Trees**: Solutions for binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and more.
- **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Solutions for optimizing recursive problems, including knapsack, longest common subsequence, etc.
- **Arrays**: Classic problems like searching, sorting, merging, and finding subarrays.
- **Strings**: String manipulation problems, pattern matching, and substring search.
